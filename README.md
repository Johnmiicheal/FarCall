#P!nG

Yep, uses PeerJs to communicate between browsers on the same network... Now the network part of this is comming soon so that you can find friends who are online and then p!ng them...

But for now, if you want to call, you have get the user id of the friend you want to call.

##TODO
== The UI sucks, better fix that...soon

== There's a flaw in the communication stream, there is no path for it to flow, hence I will have to create an easy route where you can choose who you want to p!ng
